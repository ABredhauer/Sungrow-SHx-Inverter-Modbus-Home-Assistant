Sungrow SH Integration for Home Assistant for SH3.6RS, SH4.6RS, SH5.0RS, SH5.0RT, SH6.0RS, SH8.0RT, SH6.0RT, SH10RT

The register mapping is based on two files, which the Sungrow support sent me by eMail. I am not sure, if I am allowed to share the documents, but maybe you can search for them...

"Communication Protocol of Residential Hybrid InverterV1.0.22_20201117.pdf
"10.4 Communication Protocol_String Inverter_V1.1.36_EN.pdf"


Tested with a Sungrow SH10.RT Inverter and a PylonTech Force H1 battery, Home Assistant in version 2021.11.


Please let me know, if the integration works also with other Sungrow SH* models. 
The manual also mentiones following Sungrow inverters, it may also work. Please give me a feeback.
