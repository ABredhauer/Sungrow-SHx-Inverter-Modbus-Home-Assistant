# Collection of dashboards

contributions are very welcome!

Please send me your dashboard via Pullrequest

- Create a subfolder {HACS_}%DESRCIPTION%_%YOUR_NAME%
-- {HACS_} should be pre-pended, if the dashboard is using HACS addons
-- %DESCRIPTION%: Short (1-3 words) description of the dashboard
-- %YOUR_NAME%: required to get your the well-deserved fame 

-- Examples:
-- "_DefaultDashboard_mkaiser"   (not using HACS here, because it shall be easy to use). I underlined it, so it will be always on top (as it is the default)
-- "HACS_PowerFlow_mkaiser"     (uses the HACS addon for powerflow)


- Add (multiple) screenshots
- Add README with install instructions (if required)
